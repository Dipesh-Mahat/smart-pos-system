# Authentication Flow Enhancement

This document details the enhancements made to the authentication system for the Smart POS System.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. HTTP-Only Cookie for Refresh Tokens

We've enhanced the security of refresh tokens by storing them in HTTP-only cookies instead of in localStorage:

- HTTP-only cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript, protecting against XSS attacks
- The server sets the cookie automatically upon login/token refresh
- The browser automatically sends the cookie with every request to our domain
- Refresh tokens are now protected from client-side JavaScript access

### 2. Token Blacklisting

To prevent token reuse and improve security, we've implemented token blacklisting:

- When a user logs out, their tokens are added to a blacklist
- The auth middleware checks if tokens are blacklisted before allowing access
- This prevents unauthorized access with stolen or reused tokens
- Blacklisted tokens are automatically cleaned up after they expire

### 3. Automatic Token Refresh

The system now features a robust token refresh mechanism:

- Tokens are automatically refreshed at 85% of their lifetime
- Refresh timers persist across page reloads
- API calls automatically retry with fresh tokens if authentication fails
- Users remain logged in without interruptions

### 4. Token Revocation on Logout

When a user logs out:

- Both access and refresh tokens are blacklisted
- Cookies are cleared
- Local storage is cleared
- This ensures complete session termination

## Implementation Details

### Backend

1. **Token Controller**: Handles token refresh and revocation
2. **Auth Middleware**: Verifies tokens and checks the blacklist
3. **Token Blacklist**: In-memory store for invalidated tokens (will be replaced with Redis in production)

### Frontend

1. **Auth Service**: Handles all token management logic
2. **API Service**: Manages authenticated API requests with automatic token refresh
3. **Login/Logout Flow**: Updated to use HTTP-only cookies

## Security Considerations

1. **XSS Protection**: Refresh tokens are protected in HTTP-only cookies
2. **CSRF Protection**: Cookies use SameSite=Strict to prevent CSRF attacks
3. **Token Reuse Prevention**: Blacklisting prevents token reuse after logout
4. **Short-lived Access Tokens**: Access tokens expire quickly to limit damage from theft

## Next Steps

1. **Token Rotation**: Implement refresh token rotation on each refresh
2. **Session Management**: Add the ability to view and revoke active sessions
3. **Redis Integration**: Replace in-memory blacklist with Redis for distributed deployments
4. **Rate Limiting**: Enhance rate limiting for auth endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
